------------------- original text ---------------------------
The version of Gzip contained in this gate, 1.3.3, is the latest
version released by the official maintainers. Following the release of
this version, a number of issues were discovered which affected
Solaris and for which it was deemed important to release a patch.
However, the Gzip source code is no longer being maintained by the
community. As a result, the diff file gzip-1.3.3.patch was created
which contains the differences between our released version and the
current official release. This is applied using gpatch during the
build process.

In order to distinguish the Sun patched version from the official
community version, the version number as reported by the utility at
runtime has been changed to: 1.3.3-patch.1

If in the future a new official version of Gzip is released, it should
be determined whether that later version still contains the problems
fixed by this patch. If it does not, this patch can be removed from
the gate and the build process when the later version is integrated
into the gate. If they are still present, this patch will have to be
modified to be applicable to that later version before it is
integrated into the gate.

The patch file contains the following changes:

1) configure : The version number used during build time has been
   modifed as described above.

2) gzip.c: [ 6283819 gzip TOCTOU file-permissions vulnerability ]

   The code for this fix came from the patch used by the Debian
   community to address the same issue in their distribution, and was
   extracted from the patch downloaded from:

http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/g/gzip/gzip_1.3.2-3woody5.diff.gz

3) gzip.c: [ 6294656 gzip vulnerability <=1.3.5: a malicious archive
   may write unintended files when uncompressed with -N ]

   The code for this fix came from the patch used by the Debian
   community to address the same issue in their distribution, and was
   extracted from the patch downloaded from:
